# This is a sample input configuration file for Shaka Streamer for using an
# external command as input.  This particular example only runs on Linux or
# macOS, and requires a tool called Gource (https://gource.io/).  You can
# adapt this to any other external command that generates video or audio.

# List of inputs.

    # The type of input.
  - input_type: external_command
    # The command to run.  Here $SHAKA_STREAMER_EXTERNAL_COMMAND_OUTPUT
    # (or %SHAKA_STREAMER_EXTERNAL_COMMAND_OUTPUT% on Windows) is replaced
    # with the output pipe.
