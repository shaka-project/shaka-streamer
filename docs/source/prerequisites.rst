Installing Prerequisites
========================

Yaml Module (required for development only)
-------------------------------------------

We use the `Python "yaml" module`_ to parse config files.  If you install Shaka
Streamer via ``pip3``, then this dependency will be installed for you
automatically.  If you got Shaka Streamer source from GitHub, you will need to
install the module separately.

To install it on Ubuntu:

.. code:: sh

  sudo apt -y install python3-yaml

This can also be installed via ``pip3`` on any platform:

.. code:: sh

  # To install/upgrade globally (drop the "sudo" for Windows):
  sudo pip3 install --upgrade pyyaml

  # To install/upgrade per-user:
  pip3 install --user --upgrade pyyaml


Shaka Streamer Binaries package (recommended)
---------------------------------------------

Shaka Streamer requires `Shaka Packager`_ and `FFmpeg`_ as it uses them
internally.

These binaries can be installed for your platform easily with the
``shaka-streamer-binaries`` package:

.. code:: sh

  pip3 install shaka-streamer-binaries

The static FFmpeg builds are pulled from here:
https://github.com/shaka-project/static-ffmpeg-binaries

The static Shaka Packager builds are pulled from here:
https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager


Shaka Packager (manual installation, not recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------

Pre-built Shaka Packager binaries can be downloaded from github here:
https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager/releases

To install a Shaka Packager binary on Linux:

.. code:: sh

   sudo install -m 755 ~/Downloads/packager-linux \
     /usr/local/bin/packager

To build Shaka Packager from source, follow instructions here:
https://shaka-project.github.io/shaka-packager/html/build_instructions.html


FFmpeg (manual installation, not recommended)
---------------------------------------------

If your Linux distribution has FFmpeg v4.1+, you can just install the package.
For example, this will work in Ubuntu 19.04+:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt -y install ffmpeg

For older versions of Ubuntu or any other Linux distro which does not have a
new enough version of FFmpeg, you can build it from source. For example:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt -y install \
     libx264-dev libvpx-dev libopus-dev libfreetype6-dev \
     libfontconfig1-dev libsdl2-dev yasm \
     va-driver-all libnvidia-encode1

   git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg ffmpeg
   cd ffmpeg
   git checkout n4.1.3
   ./configure \
     --enable-libx264 --enable-libvpx --enable-libopus \
     --enable-gpl --enable-libfreetype --enable-libfontconfig
   make
   sudo make install

For macOS, you can either build FFmpeg from source or you can use `Homebrew`_
to install it:

.. code:: sh

   brew install ffmpeg


Cloud Storage (optional)
------------------------

Shaka Streamer can push content directly to a Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3
bucket. To use this feature, the Google Cloud SDK is required.

See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install for details on installing the Google
Cloud SDK on your platform.


Google Cloud Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you havenâ€™t already, you will need to initialize your gcloud environment and
log in through your browser.

.. code:: sh

   gcloud init

Follow the instructions given to you by gcloud to initialize the environment
and login.


Amazon S3
~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate to Amazon S3, you can either add credentials to your `boto
config file`_ or login interactively using the `AWS CLI`_.


Test Dependencies (optional)
----------------------------

To run the end-to-end tests, you must install Flask and NPM. In Ubuntu 19.04+:

.. code:: sh

  sudo apt -y install python3-flask nodejs npm
  # Upgrade to a recent npm, which is not packaged:
  sudo npm install -g npm

Flask can also be installed via ``pip3`` on any platform:

.. code:: sh

  # To install/upgrade globally (drop the "sudo" for Windows):
  sudo pip3 install --upgrade flask

  # To install/upgrade per-user:
  pip3 install --user --upgrade flask


To install Node.js and NPM on any other platform, you can try one of these:
